Timer Challenge
Timer Challenge is a dynamic web application built using React. This project showcases the use of React hooks like useState() and useRef(), along with more advanced concepts such as forwarding refs, useImperativeHandle hooks, and React portals to enhance the manipulation and management of DOM elements in a React application.

Features
Timer Functionality: Implements basic timer functionality allowing users to start, stop, and reset the timer.
Advanced Hook Usage: Utilizes useState() for state management and useRef() to access DOM nodes directly.
Forwarding Refs: Implements forwarding refs technique to pass refs down to child components.
Expose Component Methods via useImperativeHandle: Demonstrates how to expose methods from child components to parent components using the useImperativeHandle hook.
React Portals: Uses portals to render components into a different part of the DOM tree, showcasing a modal implementation as an example.
